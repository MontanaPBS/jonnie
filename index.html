            <!--<h2 class="subheader airs">NOW STREAMING ON MONTANA PBS PASSPORT</h2> -->
            <p class="about-content">Jonnie Jonckowski is a Montana legend. She grew up with a passion for horses, natural
                athleticism, and an unquenchable competitive drive. In her early twenties—just when her dream of becoming an Olympic
                pentathlete was within reach—she was permanently sidelined by a back injury. In search of a new challenge, she set
                her sights on an unlikely pursuit: professional bull riding.</p>
           </br>
            <p class="about-content">A woman in a man’s world, Jonnie’s obsession with being the best defied expectations,
                challenged gender stereotypes, and earned her two world championships. It also resulted in numerous broken bones,
                life-threatening injuries, and a personal life peppered with financial hardship, heartbreak, and even tragedy.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="about-content">At sixty-nine years old, Jonnie no longer competes in the violent sport that required
                cold-blooded focus and the unwitting participation of wild bulls. Now her home in Billings is a refuge for rescued
                horses, where she brings seniors citizens and at-risk youth for a dose of equine therapy. These profound
                interactions—in stark contrast to her former life—are gentle and emotional. They give isolated and neglected people
                a space to connect and heal.</p>
                
            </br>
            <p class="about-content">The one-hour documentary Jonnie chronicles the life of an extraordinary woman with
                extraordinary mental and physical toughness. Archival footage tells the story of Jonnie’s thrilling rise to the top
                of her profession. Her articulate and at times humorous accounts of moving through life as a born competitor provide
                the narrative backdrop. Expert interviews touch on the surprising history of women’s rodeo in the United States and
                offer fascinating technical analysis of Jonnie’s best performances.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="about-content">Jonnie promises to be a dynamic and cinematic tribute to a uniquely Montana character. At once
                inspiring and enlightening, the film explores human resilience and our evolving relationship with animals and the
                natural world. Jonnie examines the human need to make an impact and find meaning in whatever we do.</p>
